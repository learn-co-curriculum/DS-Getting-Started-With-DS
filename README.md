# Teacher Notes

## Introduction

This is the first lesson of the program! As such, one of the most important aspects is appropriate introductions and developing a productive learning environment.

## Learning Goals


* Explain the classes of problems that data science can be used to solve
* Describe the data science process
* Navigate a Jupyter notebook
* Activate a conda environment
* Manipulate and traverse python data structures

## Lesson Outline
* Welcome / Introductions (5-10 minutes general introductions or 20-30 minutes if using paired activity (see additional resources at bottom)
* Exploring the Data Science Process
    * Problem Introduction (3 minutes)
    * Groupwork (10-15 minutes)
    * Group Presentations (10 minutes)
    * Whole Class Discussion (5-10 minutes)

## Prerequisite Knowledge

No required prerequisites. If desired, you can distribute the reading materials regarding data science work flows (see below) for the class exercise ahead of time.


## Materials

* Student version of this slide deck: Getting Started with Data Science
* Whiteboards / Posterpaper + Markers for group activity

## Problem Scenario

You are part of a team of contractors working ETL at a large train-related private/public partnership company. A VP knows you have a background in data science and comes up to you and says "I want us to start using predictive analytics". What do you say?

# Teacher Notes

Take 3-5 minutes to survey some initial student responses. Try and keep this conversation brief before moving forward.

## Data Science Workflows

Break into groups. Each group should take one of the following articles. 
    
- [Battle of the Data Science Venn Diagrams](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/10/battle-data-science-venn-diagrams.html)
- [10 Data Analytics Success Stories: A Closer Look](https://www.cio.com/article/3221621/analytics/6-data-analytics-success-stories-an-inside-look.html)
- [Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/supervised-vs-unsupervised-learning-14f68e32ea8d)
- [Beyond Interactive: Notebook Innovation at Netflix](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/notebook-innovation-591ee3221233)
- [The 25 Best Data Visualizations of 2018](https://visme.co/blog/best-data-visualizations/)

- [Video: “Full Stack” Data Science at Stitch Fix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErrHRMiNNXE) or [Stitch Fix Algorithms Tour](https://algorithms-tour.stitchfix.com/)  
  
For your article, answer the following:
- Describe the data science process
- Explain the classes of problems that data science can be used to solve
- Define what makes a good data science question
- List questions you can ask at the start of the process

# Teacher Notes


* Reference readings
* Reference diverse experiences in the field and in the classroom
* Break students into small groups, give a whiteboard or piece of paper to each and ask them to draw/diagram the following:
        a data science machine
        the data science process
        what goes in
        what comes out
        what happens in the middle
    
Allow groups ~10-15 minutes to review their articles and answer the class questions. Then have students present out their articles and question answers to the class.

Ask students to present results to large group

Afterwards, prompt students to generate a list of commonalities they saw between the presentations.


Informal assessment:
Ask a question or two: did anyone find this surprising?


### Review Syllabus

Step: Reflection:
Time: 2 min

Small reflection of reaction to training. Will provide bank of these questions on teacher training wiki.
